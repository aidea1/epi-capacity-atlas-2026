# US Epidemiology Capacity Atlas

**A reproducible, state-level epidemiology capacity atlas derived from the NACCHO Profile public-use dataset.**

This repository generates an interactive, static HTML dashboard that visualizes epidemiology and surveillance capacity across U.S. states using standardized Local Health Department (LHD) survey data.

The atlas is designed for:
- public health researchers
- policy analysts
- workforce planners
- funders and decision-makers

## What this atlas measures

The dashboard includes three epidemiology-specific indices (0–100):

1. **Direct Epidemiology / Surveillance Capacity**  
   Percent of epidemiology and surveillance domains performed directly by LHDs  
   (mean across 7 domains × 100)

2. **Any Epidemiology / Surveillance Availability**  
   Percent of domains available from any source  
   (LHD direct, contracted, or other community providers)

3. **Epidemiology / Surveillance Not Available**  
   Percent of domains reported as not available in the community

Domains include:
- Communicable disease
- Chronic disease
- Injury
- Behavioral risk factors
- Environmental health
- Syndromic surveillance
- Maternal & child health
